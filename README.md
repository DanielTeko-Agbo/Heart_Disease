In this notebook, I am going to be working on the heart disease dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).

I am going to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data to gain insights and also make models to predict the presence of a heart disease.


The modules used in this python project are:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Plotly
* Cufflinks
* Scikit-Learn
